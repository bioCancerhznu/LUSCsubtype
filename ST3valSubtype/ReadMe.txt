The code in this content is used to train a random forest model on the training set (TCGA) and then apply it to predict subtypes based on the expression matrices from independent testing sets, GSE30219 and GSE73403. Subsequently, survival curves are plotted for the predicted subtypes in these testing sets. If the differences in survival curves between subtypes are consistent across the training and testing sets, it confirms the robustness and reproducibility of the subtype classification.
